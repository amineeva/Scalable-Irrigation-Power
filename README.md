# Scalable-Irrigation-Power

This project was completed in the fall 2024 semester by Alex Mineeva and Mateo Brancolli for ENGR2360: Introduction to Thermal-Fluid Systems at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. Thank you to Alessandra Ferzoco for your support and mentorship!

### Design Challenge #4. Low-cost, off-grid irrigation system for farmers

#### An additional facet of climate resiliency for our regional food supply chain and local farms is irrigation infrastructure.  For this design challenge you will specify off-grid power generators needed to irrigate a local farm of your choosing.  The primary design constraint is cost, both up front capital costs and operational costs.  What options could you provide a farmer?
